  servings: 6 cups
  prep: 5 minutes
  cook: 8 minutes
  ingredients: |-
    **Tea**

    * 6 cups purified water
    * 1-1/2 Tbsp fresh ginger; peeled and chopped
    * 2 medium lemons; juiced (~1/2 cup fresh lemon juice)
    * 1/8 tsp cayenne
    * 1/4 tsp cinnamon
    * 1/4 cup maple syrup; grade B

  directions: |-
    1. In the Vitamix, add the water & ginger. Blend from low to high for approximately 60 seconds. The water should turn yellow and the ginger should be pulverized. Any remaining chucks will be strained later.
    2. Add cinnamon & cayenne to the ginger mixture. Turn the Vitamix to the `Soup` setting and hit start.
    3. Once the liquid is hot and the Vitamix turns off, pour the mixture through a mesh strainer or cheese cloth to remove and remaining ginger pulp.
    4. Add the tea, lemon juice, & sweetener back into the Vitamix and give it a quick blend to mix the ingredients.
    5. Enjoy! Tweak to taste and serve warm. Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator.

This spicy & sweet tea is good any time, but especially when you're feeling under the weather. Fantastic warm or cold.
