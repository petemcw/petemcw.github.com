I saw this workout posted on [Men's Health](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a25298524/chris-hemsworth-mib-workout/) a while back and I'm republishing it here for my own quick access.

## The Warmup

Perform 10 tabata rounds (20 seconds on, 10 seconds off) of both exercises. Start slow and get faster as you progress through the rounds.

## The Workout

Perform **8 reps** of each exercise consecutively as a circuit. Don't rest between moves, and rest as little as possible between sets. Repeat the circuit **3 times**.
